#CSE 340 Project
# Development-of-a-Basic-Language-Compiler
The goal of this project is to implement a small compiler. We will write a compiler for a simple language. 
We will not be generating assembly code. Instead, we will generate an intermediate representation (a data structure
that represents the program). The execution of the program will be done after compilation by
interpreting the generated intermediate representation using an interpreter that was provided.
